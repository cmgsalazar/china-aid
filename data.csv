4036,89494,Yes,31,No,China (People's Republic of),Malaysia,MYS,Asia,2019,,,"Bank of China contributes to $5.65 billion syndicated loan for Project Marigold (Linked to Project ID#89496, #89495, #89485, #89486, #89497, and #89498)","On March 28, 2018, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd (collectively known as PRefChem) were legally incorporated as joint ventures owned by Petronas (50% equity stake) and Saudi Aramco (50% equity stake). PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, Técnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.

To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations.

A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, Técnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, Técnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.  Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89494. ICBC’s estimated contribution ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89495. China Construction Bank’s estimated contribution  ($281,500,000) to the $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility is captured via Project ID#89496. Bank of China’s estimated contribution ($98,625,000) to the $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89497 and its estimated contribution ($158,800,000) to the $794 million SACE-covered tranche is captured via Project ID#89498.  The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, Técnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","1.

8385,62466,No,1383,No,China (People's Republic of),Cambodia,KHM,Asia,2016,2017.0,,"China Eximbank to fund EPC contract for Phase 1 of Cambodia's First Oil Refinery Project (linked to #85525, #85490)","On December 28, 2012, Cambodian Petrochemical Company (CPC) — a private company — formed an unnamed joint venture with China Perfect Machinery Industry Co., Ltd. (also known as China Pufa Machinery Industry Co., Ltd.- a subsidiary of Sinomach) to invest in the construction of Cambodia’s first oil refinery, which at the time was expected to cost $2.3 billion USD in total (see linked ProjectID#85525).  Then, during the visit of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to China on April 8, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB), Sinopec (Sinomach), China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), and Cambodian Petrochemical Company (CPC or 柬埔寨石油化工有限公司) signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation on the project in which CDB pledged a $1.67 billion loan for the construction of a five-million-ton oil refinery in Cambodia.  The refinery would be located on 365 hectare (ha) site — in Toek Thla commune within Prey Nop district — that straddles Kampot and Preah Sihanouk provinces and it was expected to reduce petroleum imports, lower costs, and improve national energy security, particularly once ‘Block A’ begins producing oil. CDB's $1.67 billion pledge towards this project appears to have fallen through, as China Eximbank subsequently conducted due diligence on the oil refinery project, and on October 16, 2013, CPC and China Eximbank signed a $1.666 billion financing framework agreement for the Oil Refinery Project (as captured in ProjectID#85490). This agreement specified that the $1.96 billion (lowered from $2.3 billion as stipulated in the 2012 construction agreement) project would be implemented in two phases.  CPC and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Northeast Refining & Chemical Engineering Company signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for Phase 1 on May 5, 2016. However, this contract appears to have been canceled because CPC signed another EPC contract worth $620 million (RMB 4.135 billion) Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment Co., Ltd. (兰州兰石重型装备股份有限公司) on September 20, 2016. According to the contract, China Eximbank is expected to finance 85% of the contract cost, and CPC agreed to allow the lender to disburse funds directly to the EPC contractor. Sinosure also agreed to insure the loan with buyer's credit insurance, and Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment Co., Ltd. (兰州兰石重型装备股份有限公司) provided a guarantee.The validity of the contract is dependent on China Eximbank's provision of financing.   On April 27, 2017, the EPC contract between CPC and Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment was terminated due to inability of Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment to secure financing and credit insurance. CPC signed another EPC+F contract (worth RMB 4,268,000,000) with Sino Great Wall International Engineering Group of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on April 26, 2017. Sino Great Wall International Engineering Group is expected to coordinate the financing arrangement of the project. There is no mention of any financing from China Eximbank in the contract.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 of the project then took place on May 4, 2017; however, Sino Great Wall International Engineering Group subsequently announced that its work on the project was halted. As of 2018, Sino Great Wall International Engineering Group contributed 79,605,206.92 RMB and CPC contributed 248,272,371.05 RMB to the project. Media reports in mid-2019 indicate that the project encountered ‘financing problems’ and would likely recommence in 2022. Work is currently still paused.","1. This project is also known as the Kinlandmark Oil Refinery Project. The Chinese project title is 柬埔寨500万吨炼油厂项目 or 的柬埔寨500 万吨/年炼油厂项目一期工.2. Some sources suggest that this project is being implemented by a joint venture between CPC and CNPC, while other suggest the joint venture consists of CPC and Sinomach.3. Even though CPC agreed to allow the lender to disburse funds directly to the EPC contractor, which was Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment Co., Ltd. at the time of signing, because of the change in contractors, it is unknown whether the China Eximbank funding was disbursed directly to Sino Great Wall Co., Ltd.; therefore, Cambodian Petrochemical Company has been coded as the receiving_agency.4. It is unclear whether any China Eximbank financing is committed to fund the contract between CPC and Sino Great Wall Co., Ltd. Status coded as pledge for now. This issue merits further investigation.

The Loan Unit of Timor-Leste’s Ministry of Finance subsequently reviewed a loan financing proposal from China Eximbank for the project. However, there is no evidence that a loan agreement was ever finalized. The purpose of the project is to construct a four-lane highway from the town, port and airport at Suai and the proposed oil and gas industry facilities in Betano (Manufahi) via Beaco (Viqueque).  In January 2016, construction for the Suai Expressway Project (东帝汶苏艾高速公路) began as part of Timor Leste's greater 15 billion USD Tasi Mane Project. On November 17th, 2018, the first phase of the intended four-lane expressway opened to traffic. The contractor China Overseas Engineering Group Co., Ltd pursued a joint venture with China Railway First Group Co., Ltd (COVEC-CRFG) to establish the China Railway International First Bureau East Timor Joint Venture Company (中海外－中铁一局东帝汶联营体公司), to build the Suai Expressway. COVEC-CRFG's parent company is China Railway International.  After two years of construction, the 155 km expressway runs from the city of Suai in the south to Beaço in the north. According to the Japan Times, the highway intends to link the Suai airport with Beaço, a coastal town that will host an LNG plant -- a petrochemical refinery and supply base (see project #64002). The first phase of the project is 30.355 km in length, four-lane, two way highway. According to China Railway First Group, the speed limit will vary between 60 and 100 km/hour and reduce travel time between Suai and Beaço to less than two hours.  As of 2018, this project is the largest infrastructure construction project in Timor Leste's history and the first highway in Timor Leste.. According to the Environmental Justice Atlas, the total budget for the remainer of the highway is estimated to be 500 million USD but as of September 2019, funding for stages 2-4 has yet to be allocated by the government.",,Pipeline: Pledge,Development,Loan,Loan,0.25,Vague (Official Finance),150,GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,Yes,,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),State-owned Policy Bank,No,,,Government of Timor-Leste,Recipient Government Agency,,,,"China Overseas Engineering Group Co., Ltd.|China Railway First Group Co,.

(LCPC or 老中东岩石化股份有限公司) was legally incorporated as a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Yunnan Dongyan Industrial Co., Ltd. (75% ownership stake), Lao State Fuel Company (20% ownership stake), and Lao-China Joint Investment Co., Ltd. (5% ownership stake).  The Yunnan Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) organized an RMB 850 million syndicated loan to Lao-China Dongyan Petrochemical Co Ltd  for Phase 1 of the Lao-China Oil Refinery Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the project encountered ‘funding problems’ in October 2015 and it was temporarily suspended.   Phase 1 involved the construction of a petrochemical refinery with a production capacity of 1-million tons per year (tpy). The refinery is located within the energy and chemical district of the Vientiane Saysettha Development Zone (VSDZ) in Vientiane. Sitting on over 218,677 square meters, the project’s first phase also involved the construction of three buildings and 16 oil tanks with a total storage capacity of 80 million liters. Luoyang Ruize Petrochemical Engineering Limited Company (RPEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation.   On November 25, 2014, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place. Then, on April 8, 2015, the deputy prime ministers of the Lao government visited the project site to attend the project commencement ceremony. As of December 2016, the project had achieved a 35% completion rate. At that time, the project was scheduled to reach completion in November 2017. An equity share transfer agreement was signed on March 1, 2017, which changed the ownership structure of LCPC such that Yunnan Provincial Overseas Investment Co. Ltd. holds a 59% ownership stake, Yunnan Dongyan Industrial Co., Ltd. holds a 16% ownership stake, Lao State Fuel Company holds a 20% ownership stake, and Lao-China Joint Investment Co., Ltd. holds a 5% ownership stake. LCPC signed new articles of association and a new operating agreement on on March 10, 2017.   As of August 2017, the project had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was ultimately completed and commissioned on November 30, 2020. The refinery will produce 8,000 barrels per day (b/d) of gasoline and 10,000 b/d of diesel when it reaches full capacity (after the completion of the project’s second and third phases). The refinery, which has 500,000 tons per year (t/yr) of diesel hydrogenation capacity, is also expected produce 35,000 t/yr of LPG, 12,000 t/yr of pure benzene and 4,000 t/yr of sulphur at full capacity. The benzene and sulphur will be sold to China.","1. The Chinese project title is 老中联合投资建设成品油精制项目 or  老挝石油化工股份有限公司300万吨/年炼化项目. 2. CDB is the only known member of the loan syndicate.

Then, during the visit of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen to China on April 8, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB), Sinopec (Sinomach), China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), and Cambodian Petrochemical Company (CPC or 柬埔寨石油化工有限公司) signed a Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation on the project in which CDB pledged a $1.67 billion loan for the construction of a five-million-ton oil refinery in Cambodia.  The refinery would be located on 365 hectare (ha) site — in Toek Thla commune within Prey Nop district — that straddles Kampot and Preah Sihanouk provinces and it was expected to reduce petroleum imports, lower costs, and improve national energy security, particularly once ‘Block A’ begins producing oil. CDB's $1.67 billion pledge towards this project appears to have been canceled, as China Eximbank subsequently conducted due diligence on the oil refinery project, and on October 16, 2013, CPC and China Eximbank signed a $1.666 billion financing framework agreement for the Oil Refinery Project. This agreement specified that the $1.96 billion project (lowered from $2.3 billion as stipulated in the 2012 construction agreement) would be implemented in two phases.  CPC and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) Northeast Refining & Chemical Engineering Company signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for Phase 1 on May 5, 2016. However, this contract appears to have canceled because CPC signed another EPC contract worth $620 million (RMB 4.135 billion) Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment Co., Ltd.  (兰州兰石重型装备股份有限公司) on September 20, 2016.  China Eximbank approved a loan to finance 85% of the cost ($527 million) of this contract (as captured in linked ProjectID#62466), and CPC agreed to allow the lender to disburse funds directly to the EPC contractor. Sinosure also agreed to insure the loan. However, this EPC contract also appears to have been canceled because CPC signed another EPC contract (worth RMB 4,268,000,000) with Sino Great Wall International Engineering Group of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on April 26, 2017.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony then took place on May 4, 2017; however, Sino Great Wall International Engineering Group subsequently announced that its work on the project was halted. Media reports in mid-2019 indicate that the project encountered ‘financing problems’ and would likely recommence in 2022. Work is currently still paused.","This project is also known as the Kinlandmark Oil Refinery Project. The Chinese project title is 柬埔寨500万吨炼油厂项目 or 的柬埔寨500 万吨/年炼油厂项目一期工.Some sources suggest that this project is being implemented by a joint venture between CPC and CNPC, while other suggest the joint venture consists of CPC and Sinomach.Even though CPC agreed to allow the lender to disburse funds directly to the EPC contractor, which was Lanzhou LS Heavy Equipment Co., Ltd. at the time of signing, because of the change in contractors, it is unknown whether the China Eximbank funding was disbursed directly to Sino Great Wall Co., Ltd.; therefore, Cambodian Petrochemical Company has been coded as
